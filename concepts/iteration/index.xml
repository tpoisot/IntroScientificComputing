These three words are if, for, and while. If you have some previous experience with writing code, you can skim through this lesson and the next.
One great way to make your code robust is to keep it very simple, and one great way to keep your code very simple is to recognize that often, we want to do one of three things: do one thing if something happens (if), do one thing to a series of things (for), or do one thing until something happens (while).</description></item><item><title>Naive Bayes classifier</title><link>https://sciencecomputing.io/capstones/naive_bayesian_classifier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sciencecomputing.io/capstones/naive_bayesian_classifier/</guid><description>In this capstone, we will implement a Naive Bayes classifier, to make predictions about the cultivar to which wheat seeds belong. This is a classification task, meaning that we want to get an answer that looks like class A or class B, as opposed to a regression problem in which we would like to get an answer like length = 0.8cm. At its core, Naive Bayes classification assumes that the probability of belonging to a class based on a single measurement is equal to the probability that this measurement&amp;rsquo;s values originate from the distribution of known values for the class.</description></item><item><title>Iteration and array navigation</title><link>https://sciencecomputing.io/lessons/iteration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sciencecomputing.io/lessons/iteration/</guid><description>Introducing iteration The for operation is one of the most common, but also one of the most confusing, ways to tell a computer what to do. This is because it requires to understand a lot of concepts at once; we will walk through each of them, get confused a little bit, then get confused a lot, then get it.
When talking about for, we usually talk about for loops or iteration.</description></item></channel></rss>
