      <description>Genetic algorithm is a heuristic that takes heavy inspiration from evolutionary biology, to explore a space of parameters rapidly and converge to an optimum. Every solution is a &amp;ldquo;genome&amp;rdquo;, and the combinations can undergo mutation and recombination. By simulating a process of reproduction, over sufficiently many generation, this heuristic usually gives very good results. It is also simple to implement, and this is what we will do!
A genetic algorithm works by measuring the fitness of a solution (i.</description>
