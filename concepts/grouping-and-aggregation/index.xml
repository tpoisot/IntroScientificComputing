This is a classification task, meaning that we want to get an answer that looks like class A or class B, as opposed to a regression problem in which we would like to get an answer like length = 0.8cm. At its core, Naive Bayes classification assumes that the probability of belonging to a class based on a single measurement is equal to the probability that this measurement's values originate from the distribution of known values for the class.</description></item></channel></rss>
