      <description>Approximate Bayesian computation, or ABC for short, is a very useful heuristic to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters, specifically when the analytical expression of the likelihood function is unavailable (or when we can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to figure it out). The theory on how ABC works will not be covered here in detail, so reading the previous article is highly recommended.
We will rely on a few packages for this example:</description>

      <description>Numerical integration, the search for solutions of differential equations, is a hallmark of scientific computing. In this lesson, we will see how we can apply multipe concepts to write our own routine for the second-order Runge-Kutta method. In practice, it is never recommended to write one&amp;rsquo;s own routine for numerical integration, as there are specific packages to handle this task. In Julia, this is DifferentialEquations.jl. This being said, writing a Runge-Kutta method is an interesting exercise.</description>
