Let's practice with an exercice. We want to print all numbers between 1
and 12 that are *even*. Julia has an `iseven` function to do this, and we
will get you started with a block of code that is only missing a few
instruction -- complete it to solve the problem!

~~~
numbers = collect(1:12)

for ___ in numbers
    if ___
        println(___)
    end
end
~~~
