question = """
For this question, we want to take the k first numbers from a series
of random numbers, so that the difference between the largest and the
smallest is *at least* some arbitrary threshold. By looking at the
documentation for the `extrema` function, and by remembering what the 
`first` and `last` functions do, complete the following code:

~~~
numbers = rand(10000);
threshold = 0.5

for k in ___(numbers)
    series = ___[1:k]
    extremas = ___(___)
    if (___(___) - ___(___)) ≥ threshold
        println(___)
        break
    end
end
~~~

The `break` keyword is here to stop our loop when we have found the
correct value of k.
