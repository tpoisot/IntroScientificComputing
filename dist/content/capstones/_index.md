# Capstone lessons

The goal of these lessons is to see how the concepts covered in the [main
lessons](/lessons) can be integrated. It is recommended to go through the
capstones *after* having done the lessons. Capstones are designed to be shorter,
and will present some real-life applications of the principles covered in the
main lessons.

Capstone lessons present more advanced material, which may take a bit longer to
grasp. We encourage you to try them one at a time, and to come back to them over
the course of a few days. We also encourage you to adapt the capstones to your
own problems, and to see if they can adapted to your own data. This will be a
frustrating process, to be sure, but you will learn a lot!
