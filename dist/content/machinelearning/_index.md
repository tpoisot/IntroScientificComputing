# Machine learning capstones

These capstone lessons are meant to be followed after going through the [main
content](/lessons/). They have been developed specifically for an intensive
workshop organized jointly by [IVADO], the [bioinformatics graduate students
association][aebinum] at Université de Montréal, and the [Poisot Lab] of
Quantitative and Computational Ecology. It consists of short modules presenting
ways to implement various learning algorithms in *Julia*. They provide a few
package-specific implementations.
