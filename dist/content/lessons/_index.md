# About the lessons

This is the main content. We recommend to read these lessons in order, and to
run the code (and change parts of it to experiment) at every step. The reading
time is an *indication*. In practice, it is normal for the lessons to take you
longer. Do not hesitate to do one a day, and make sure that you *really get* the
content before moving on to the next.
