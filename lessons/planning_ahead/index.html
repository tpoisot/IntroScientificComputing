<h2 id="programming-is-intimidating">Programming is intimidating</h2>

<p>If your working environment looks anything like mine, the first thing you may
see on a new project will look like this - an empty text editor, and an empty
code interpreter. This is highly intimidating.</p>

<p><img src="../figures/white-page.png" alt="test" /></p>

<p>Facing an empty text editor at the beginning of a programming task is like
facing an empty page at the beginning of a writing project. To make it easier to
work through, one really good (but also really uncommon) approach is to walk
away from the computer. Instead of trying to write code, we will first try to
articulate the structure of our project - and not jumping to our keyboard works
really well for this.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will see how we can optimize our preparation for any project,
by having good project organization, thinking about the flowchart of our
program, and writing pseudo-code as needed.</p>

<h2 id="after-this-lesson-you-will-be-able-to">After this lesson, you will be able to &hellip;</h2>

<ul>
<li>&hellip; organize a project</li>
<li>&hellip; write the flowchart of your program</li>
<li>&hellip; work out some of the most complex pieces using pseudo-code</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-management">Project management</h2>

<p>Here is a productivity tip: work in such a way that you do not need to think
about the non-important parts of your project. For us, this means having a
standard layout for any project, and using it consistently. We will suggest one
such layout below, but this is not the only one. There are an infinity of them,
and the one that <em>works</em> is the one that works <em>for you</em>.</p>

<p>Still, there are some good guidelines to follow.</p>

<p>First, a project is a folder, everything in the project belongs to the folder,
and everything outside the folder cannot belong to the project. This is
important because it maximizes the chances that you can copy your project to
another computer, and have it &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. Of course in real life, things seldom
&ldquo;just work&rdquo;, and this is why we should pay extra care to the practices that
maximise the chances of it being the case.</p>

<div class="callout information">This is not necessarily true if your project involves remote computing - or very
large amounts of data. But then again, if you work in such a way, we expect that
you will have read the documentation, and sought proper training.</div>


<p>Second, file paths are not your friends. By far the biggest obstacle to
reproducibility is the difference in ways to tell the computer <em>where files
are</em>. We encourage to use <em>relative paths</em>, relative specifically to the folder
in which your project lives. So, for example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-raw" data-lang="raw">/home/tim/ohno/my/computer/is_a_mess/MyCoolProject/data/file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>is an <em>absolute</em> file path, from the very root of where files live. But I am
only working on <code>MyCoolProject</code> at the moment, so the <em>relative</em> path of this
file is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-raw" data-lang="raw">data/file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>Or is it? On my machine running Linux, sure. But on a Windows machine I would
use in a computer lab? The file would be at</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-raw" data-lang="raw">data\file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>This difference between <code>/</code> and <code>\</code> is trivial to us, but <em>not</em> to the computer.
So to avoid these issues, it is better to let your programming language
construct the path correclty. <em>Julia</em> has the <code>joinpath</code> function, and so we
would refer to this file as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-julia" data-lang="julia"><span class="n">joinpath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;data&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#34;file.txt&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>&quot;data/file.txt&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Third, and final principle, similar things should be grouped together. In other
words, it will be easier to navigate our project if there is a folder called
<code>data</code> and it contains data, a folder called <code>figures</code> and it contains figures,
and a folder called <code>code</code> which contains code. The name and variety of these
folders is left up to you.</p>

<p>With this in mind, here is a possible template for a project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-raw" data-lang="raw">.
├── .git                    # We use version control, always!
│   └── ...
├── artifacts               # Outputs that are not figures go here

<h2 id="flowcharts">Flowcharts</h2>

<p>One of the most powerful tool to plan a programming task is to draw a flochart.
In simple terms, a flowchart will let you map the different steps that the
program will have to follow, and see what is required for each of them. To
illustrate, we will use a flowchart not of a program, but of a pancake recipe.</p>

<p>At the beginning, it can be useful to break the task down into coarse steps:</p>

<div class="mermaid" align="center">
graph LR

prepare --> cook
cook --> eat
</div>


<p>This is not much to look at, but this is a very high-level view of what we want
to achieve. It is also easy to zoom in on every task, and try to further break
it down into smaller tasks. Let&rsquo;s do this for the task at left: <em>prepare</em>.</p>

<div class="mermaid" align="center">
graph LR

liquid[liquid ingredients] --> batter
solid[solid ingredients] --> batter
batter --> cook
cook --> eat
</div>


<p>&ldquo;All&rdquo; we have done so far is to split the <em>prepare</em> step into the preparation of
solid and liquid ingredients. To come up with a full flowchart, we need to
repeat this process until we are satisfied by the completeness of it:</p>

<div class="mermaid" align="center">
graph LR

liquid[liquid ingredients] --> mix{mix}
solid[solid ingredients] --> mix
mix --> batter
batter --> cook{cook}
cook --> eat{eat}
</div>


<p>Notice that we have introduced a new shape: the rotated square will be used to
note <em>actions</em>, and anything else will be either an output or an input of these
actions.</p>

<div class="callout opinion">We like the idea of using different shapes to indicate different steps: what
goes in, what is the action, are there any artifacts produced or side-effects?
This being said, even a very coarse flowchart can help you.</div>


<p>If we repeat the exercise for most of the boxes, we may end up with a flowchart
like this. It might seem a little overwhelming at first, but this is a helpful
document. It maps out the precise steps and processes in your project, and can
help you both to <em>plan</em> what to write, but also to <em>understand</em> what you have
written previously.</p>

<div class="mermaid" align="center">

sugar --> mix1{mix}
bak[baking powder] --> mix1
