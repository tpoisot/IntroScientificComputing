Every solution is a &amp;ldquo;genome&amp;rdquo;, and the combinations can undergo mutation and recombination. By simulating a process of reproduction, over sufficiently many generation, this heuristic usually gives very good results. It is also simple to implement, and this is what we will do!
A genetic algorithm works by measuring the fitness of a solution (i.</description></item><item><title>Neural network with Flux</title><link>http://sciencecomputing.io/machinelearning/neuralnetwork/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://sciencecomputing.io/machinelearning/neuralnetwork/</guid><description>short intro text goes here

This is a classification task, meaning that we want to get an answer that looks like class A or class B, as opposed to a regression problem in which we would like to get an answer like length = 0.8cm. At its core, Naive Bayes classification assumes that the probability of belonging to a class based on a single measurement is equal to the probability that this measurement's values originate from the distribution of known values for the class.</description></item></channel></rss>
