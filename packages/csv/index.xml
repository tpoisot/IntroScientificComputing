Flux is very well documented, and multiple step-by-step examples have been written to provide users with a solid understanding of how it can be used to build machine learning models in a few lines of code only.
We will be using the seeds dataset, which we believe is a better version of the widely used iris dataset.</description></item></channel></rss>
