lot</em> about getting the <em>right</em> answer; but of course, the <em>right</em> answer is not
always obvious. So we should be very careful with the code we write. A piece of
code that crashes is annoying; but a piece of code that runs, and give you the
wrong answer can compromise your science and your career. This guide will help
you adopt practices that make it less likely to introduce mistakes in your code,
and more likely to catch them. Hopefully, this will let all of us write code we
can trust more.</strong></p><p>Good principles in scientific computing can help you write code that is easier
to maintain, easier to reproduce, and easier to debug. But it can be difficult
to find an introduction to get you started. The goal of this project is to
provide reproducible documents you can use to get started on the most important
points. You can use these lessons on your own, or as a group.</p><p>The content is divided in three categories: <a href=/lessons/>lessons</a>,
<a href=/capstones/>capstones</a> and <a href=/primers/>primers</a>. We recommend starting by the
lessons - they will provide basic information. Capstones are examples of
real-life application of the content of lessons. Finally, primers are very short
bits of additional information, which can be browsed at any time.</p><h2 id=who-is-this-material-for>Who is this material for?</h2><p>This material is aimed at people who have already interacted with a computer
using a programming language, but want to adopt best practices that make their
code more robust. It can also be used to facilitate the onboarding of new people
in your lab or your project.</p><p>Scientific computing can be very diverse, ranging from a few-step analysis
of small data sets to simulations running for weeks on supercomputers.
We focus on the most common situations that every scientist encounters
at some stage of a research project: data analyses performed on a standard
desktop computer. The general ideas and principles that we expose carry over
to other situations as well, but the concrete tools and methods may not
be suitable for tasks requiring special hardware such as GPUs or supercomputers,
or for projects requiring a significant software development effort.</p><p>We will use the <a href=http://julialang.org/>Julia</a> programming language; but you don&rsquo;t need to know
anything about it either. We will keep the discussion very general. In fact, you
will see that good practices for scientific computing have very little to do
with tools and technical things; instead, they rely on thinking about
programming in a slightly different way. You will be able to apply these
principles to any language you prefer to use.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-this-material>How to use this material</h2><p>The best way to read this material is to keep a window with either
[JuliaBox][jlbox] or a terminal running <em>Julia</em> open, and <strong>type</strong> the code. It
is tempting to copy and paste, but typing the code actually matters.</p><p>Snippets of code that are <em>important</em> are presented this way:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-julia data-lang=julia><span class=p>[</span><span class=n>rand</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>i</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=k>for</span> <span class=n>i</span> <span class=kp>in</span> <span class=mi>1</span><span class=o>:</span><span class=mi>5</span><span class=p>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Bits of code of lower importance (pseudocode or code you are not meant to type),
are presented this way:</p><pre><code class=language-raw data-lang=raw>for each_element in vector
  function(each_element)
end
</code></pre><p>Finally, the output of code is presented this way:</p><pre><code>2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.1
 0.0
</code></pre><p>Throughout the lessons, we have added some asides &ndash; they are ranked in order of
importance. The first are &ldquo;informations&rdquo;:</p><div class="callout information">All that should matter in the choice of tools, language, environment, is that it
lets you become productive, and solve the problem you want to solve.</div><p>&ldquo;Opinions&rdquo; are points we would like to raise for the reader&rsquo;s consideration, and
can be ignored. Example:</p><div class="callout opinion">People who think it&rsquo;s OK to criticize others based on their choice of language,
OS, text editor, etc, should go home and think about what they did.</div><p>&ldquo;Warnings&rdquo; are points that can be important, but not necessarily as a novice. It
is worth keeping a mental note of them, especially in the long term. Example:</p><div class="callout warning">Any time you are about to comment on people&rsquo;s choice of tools, ask yourself
whether this is really necessary, and the answer is usually &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The Good Tool
is the one that works for its user.</div><p>&ldquo;Dangers&rdquo; are really important points, that can prove especially dangerous or
risky to everyone. They are worth reading a few times over. Example:</p><div class="callout danger">This toxic behaviour is driving brilliant people away, and should never be
tolerated. Disliking Windows has not made anyone edgy or cool since
1998.</div><h2 id=want-to-see-this-material-as-a-workshop>Want to see this material as a workshop?</h2><p>This material can be given in a workshop format, ideally over two days, covering
several lessons and one or two capstone examples. Please contact <a href=mailto:timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca>Timothée
